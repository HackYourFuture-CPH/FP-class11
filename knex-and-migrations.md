## ‚úàÔ∏è Working with migrations

Migrations are there to help manage your database when you are working in a
team. The goal of a migration is to take your database from one place (state) to
another. So it is bit like travelling. Traveling in time even?

We are trying to solve two main things with migrations:

- The pain of keeping the local database in your development environment up to
  date.
- The challenge of making schema changes to a database with real production data
  in a predictable manner.

Since migrations are typically managed by writing ad hoc SQL to create the database, create
new tables, change tables and change the data inside the database, migrations
makes all of these tasks repeatable and predictable by basically adding all of
these changes to git. Essentially the solution is to never manipulate the
database schema directly with ad hoc queries, but always to out those queries in
a script that is stored in git. Furthermore, since git allows you to "travel in
time" by checking out past commits, changing branches, etc. we need a way for
the database to keep up.

### Up üõ´ and down üõ¨ migrations

We do so by having two types of migrations. There are up migrations (üõ´) that
describes how to travel somewhere and there are down migrations (üõ¨) that
describe how to get back home again. The down migrations are key, since these
are what allows you to take your database back to an old state whenever you are
checking out an old commit or a branch from before a certain up migration was
applied. A down migration must always be the exact opposite of an up migration.
A couple of examples in pseudo code (not real code! refer to the Knex section to
learn to write real migrations):

Creating tables:

```
up migration:
  create table products
    add columns
      "name", string
      "price", decimal

down migration:
  drop table products
```

Renaming columns

```
up migration:
  select table products
    rename column
      "name" > "product name"


down migration:
  select table products
    rename column
      "product name" > "name"
```

In some cases you might have real data in your database that you need to
transform in some way. Again you must be careful to write a down migration to
revert those changes:

```
up migration:
  select table products
    select "name" from products
      replace string "foo" to "bar"


down migration:
  select table products
    select "name" from products
      replace string "bar" to "foo"
```

### Working with Knex.js

Now we have an idea what migrations are it is time to introduce
[Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/). We use Knex.js to facilitate migrations, but it
does a few other things for us:

- Manage database connection
- Manage migrations and seed files
- Expose a CLI api to help scaffold migration files and run migration commands
- Provide an api to build SQL queries

### üîå Database connection

Knex.js helps us connect to the database quickly. Take a look at the
[Knexfile](/src/server/knexfile.js).

The file contains some database credentials (which are referenced from
environment variables for security reasons) and some configuration including
setting a path to the seeds directory. This file is really all you need to start
connecting to your database when using Knex.

### ‚úàÔ∏è Migration files in Knex.js

So we learned a bit about migrations, but how do you use Knex to make them?

Knex works by scanning the `/migrations` folder and looking for migrations _that
have not yet been applied to the database_. How does it keep track of this?
Easy. It has it's own table in the database `knex_migrations` where migrations
are added once they have been run.

### üå± Seed files in Knex.js

In addition to migrations which are generally concerned with updating the
structure or the "schema" of your database, Knex.js provides something called
"seeds". As the name suggest seeds are scripts that "plant" some data that can
later grow to something bigger. Often when you are building an application you
need to have some initial data in your application to test that everything
works. That might be the initial user that is able to then create more users,
organizations and so on, or it could be thousands of lines of data to load up
the application with realistic content for testing purposes.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Knex CLI

Make sure to always refer to
[the official Knex documentation for latest updates](http://knexjs.org/).

The project comes with the knex npm package pre-installed, but to use the api
smoothly it is recommended to install knex globally with:

```
npm install -g knex
```

(you might have to prefix the command with sudo if you get a write access error)

Note: When running knex commands you must always do so from the `/src/server/`
directory since knex will look for your knexfile in the directory you are
currently in.

Here is a list of some important Knex commands to know:

| Command                            | Note                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `knex migrate:latest`              | Run "latest" migrations (i.e. migrations that have not previously been run on your database). |
| `knex migrate:rollback`            | "Roll back" the latest migration.                                                             |
| `knex migrate:make migration_name` | Create a new migration file in the `/migrations` folder.                                      |
| `knex seed:run`                    | Run the seed files from the seeds folder.                                                     |

In addition to the commands above, we have a npm script called
`npm run db:setup` which is shorthand for running `knex migrate:latest` followed
by `knex seed:run`.

### Building queries in Knex.js

Knex provides a query builder interface. What it basically allows you to do is
to use an api to generate SQL similar to this:

```
const users = await knex
  .from("users")
  .select("*")
  .where({
    email: "hello@test.com
  });
```

Which will essentially generate the following SQL:

```
select * from `users` where `email` = 'hello@test.com'
```

In some cases using an API like that might be easier than writing raw SQL, as
there is less risk of making mistakes when trying to put together dynamic SQL
queries, concatenating strings and values from different sources. But on the
other hand, it also requires learning a new API which may add additional
overhead. We cannot provide the API documentation here, but you can find all the
instructions you need at [http://knexjs.org/](http://knexjs.org/). Furthermore
this [Cheat sheet](https://devhints.io/knex) might be helpful.

Using query builders like Knex, or even Object-Relation Mappers (ORMs), is
subject to much debate among developers. Some believe it is worth it learning to
use an API to interact with the database, others believe it is more value to
become good at using SQL, rather than abstracting it away. Using Knex' query
builder functionalities are _not mandatory_ for this project, but we find that
the API is simple enough that it might be helpful. _Using migrations, however,
is a mandatory part of this project_.

If you do not wish to use the knex query builder api, you can always use the
command `knex.raw()` to execute "raw" SQL statements against your database while
still leveraging Knex to connect to the database:

```
knex.raw('select * from `users` where `email` = "hello@test.com"');
```
