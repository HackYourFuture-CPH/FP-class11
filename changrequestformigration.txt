-----------
1>area_users /area_material_logs/batch_area_crop_stages/batch_area_nonreusable_resource_consumption/batch_area_status/user_roles

3>On DB field name is displaying “deleted_at”  on all tables but on JSON file its  “deleted” .
4>On DB field name “fk_user_id” is there but on JSON file it’s not there on the Crops table.
5> On DB field name “created_at”/“updated_at” is not there on Units table but its there on the JSON file.
