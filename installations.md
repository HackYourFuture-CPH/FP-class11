## Prerequisites

#### Mysql workbench
Install it from here:

Windows: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/

Mac: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/osx-installation-pkg.html

#### Setting up on Windows
Only thing Windows users have to do is run the following command anywhere in their terminal (not necessarily the project folder): npm install -g win-node-env

Refer to this post on stackoverflow for more info.

#### Install Node
Refer to this points on how to install on your OS:

Linux
Windows
Mac
Installing
Run npm install to install all required dependencies.


#### Prettier
The Project comes pre setup with Prettier, which is a tool that will automatically format your code. Prettier is currently set up to format your code right before committing to git, so there should be no risk of someone committing something that does not live up to our coding style.

You may, however, optionally install the Prettier VS Code extension to format your code on every single save. This has the benefit that you will always be looking at code in the right format and you will know exactly what gets committed at any time.

In VS Code you can press CTRL+P (CMD+P on Mac) and type ext install esbenp.prettier-vscode to install the extension directly or you can browser and find it in the Marketplace.

Remember to enable "format on save" in VS Code settings. You can also enable formatting on pasting or while editing, depending on your taste.


#### Environment variables

Environment variables are used for working with sensitive data like passwords
and usernames.

Fx connecting to a database, we dont want to commit the code that shows our
password. Therefore we use environment variables instead. The `.env` **SHOULD
NEVER** be commited!!!! Therefore it is in the `.gitignore` file (ignored by
git).

Here is how to get started with the `.env` file

- Copy and rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

- Open the `.env` file and update any parameters according to the environment
  you are running.

#### Database setup

Working with sql we use a tool called knex which helps with writing queries and
with changing the database structure. Check these out:
https://www.quora.com/What-is-Knex-js
https://knexjs.org/#Builder-identifier-syntax

- Install knex cli globally with: `npm i -g knex`
- Update the connection details to the database in the `.env` file
- after the server runs and you see a `connection to <db_name> db successful!`
  message you are ready to migrate tables
- To make a new migration make sure your terminal is where the `knexfile.js` is.
  Otherwise `cd` into that folder! run `knex migrate:make MIGRATION_NAME`. Fx if
  i want to make a new users table i would run `knex migrate:make users`. This
  would set up the migration file (under the `migrations` folder) for me to
  write the users table.
- To make a new seed i would run `knex seed:make 01_SEED_NAME`. Fx
  `knex seed:make 01_USERS`. This would create a new seed file in the folder
  `seeds`.
- To then actually apply the migrations and the seeds, run `npm run db:setup`
- If it was successful you should now have the tables and seeds in the database
