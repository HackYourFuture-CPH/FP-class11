## ðŸ“œ Getting the HackYourFuture certificate <a name = "certificate"></a>

To get the certificate we need to make sure that you know our stack, for us to recommend you to another company. So how do we figure this out? We look through homework and we look through the commits you create in the final project. 

Its important to say that you dont need to be an expert in everything, not at all!! You can be more interested in the frontend or the backend, but we then need to see that interest. 

But if you are missing 4 react homeworks and the one you have committed is super basic. AND we dont see some more advanced react usage, well then it becomes super hard for us to recommend you to a company that does react. Because we simply dont know if you have the skills. 

If we fell there are gaps, we will talk with you as early as possible, so you have time to show your worth!

If it comes so far that we cannot give you a certificate you can either join for the next final project or make a project (or we give you a project) where you show your skills. We truly want to give you the certificate and will help you as much as we can to get you there!
